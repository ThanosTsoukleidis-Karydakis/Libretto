# Libretto

Libretto is a Flutter Mobile Application that helps musicians plan their concerts/rehearsals, contact their bandmates and store their music scores. The application also includes:  
- Voice commands through the use of the phone's microphone
- OCR technology: The user can take a photo of the title of a musical piece and he will be redirected to its musical score (if he has it saved in his Songs archive).
- Gamification: A circular progress bar that gets fuller each time the user plans a new concert or rehearsal. The user earns "musical notes" every time he completes a progress cycle.

### Possible voice commands: 

- "Open ---Title of a song---" : Opens the music score of the specified song.
- "Songs" : Navigates the user to the Songs screen.
- "Add Event" : Navigates the user to the Add Event screen.
- "Contacts" : Navigates the user to the Contacts screen.
- "Show My Progress" : Navigates the user to the Achievements screen.
- "Delete Checked" : Deletes the checked events.
- "Sort" : Sorts the events by date.
- "Delete All" : Deletes all events.
